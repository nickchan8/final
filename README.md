# Autism and Interdependence

A series of visualizations that compare social networks of people with autism, intellectual disabilities, and 'neurotypicals', those without cognitive disability. The data sets explore size of networks, types of interactions, and satisfaction level with types of social networks. The original data set can be accessed via the [Do Social Networks Differ? Comparison of the Social Networks of People with Intellectual Disabilities, People with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Other People Living in the Community](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4544488/).

Files in the repo represent the data (spreadsheets culled from the link above).

Further explanation can be found in the step-by-step below.

# Description

From the article, I selected the datasets I was most interested to visualize and analyze (social network size, types of interaction, and satisfaction with social networks). I used [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/) to extract the data into spreadsheets. I cleaned up the data, clarified the names, and ready the data to be used in corresponding tool. With multi-variable datasets, I needed to make each line of data with all characteristics of the piece of data (i.e. with whom the interaction is with, type of interaction, number of interactions). These cleaned up datasets were then plugged into [Raw](http://app.rawgraphs.io/), [NVD3](http://nvd3.org/), and [Datamatic](http://datamatic.io/). Once the appropriate visualization styles were selected (data style, colors, fonts, etc.), I output the code into the web page to be legible alongside narrative.

# Usage

The purpose of this data visualization is to support my argument for a thesis around Interdependence in communities living with Autism. Many studies and research support the idea that people living with autism need independence. While that claim is true, it is also short-sided. A recipe for independence is a complex one, and road to getting there is long, especially for people with intellectual disabilities. My thesis argues that before any of that could happen, interdependence comes first;  Interdependence within communities of autism, as well as with neurotypicals. That means solidarity, not segregation. To understand interdependence, we need to understand the state of affairs, especially with social networks. What do social networks of people with autism look like? How big? What types of interactions? With who? And what's their level of satisfaction? Understanding this gives context to the relevance of informal support systems and its interplay with interdependence, a much needed shift in thinking about development for people with autism.

### Sketching

![Process](https://i.imgur.com/nJ41fx5.jpg)

I busted out my markers and pens. Oof it's nice to get on to paper. 

![Sketch](https://i.imgur.com/XkPi5aN.jpg)

Based on some inspiration provided in the [digital viz catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/search/relationships.html), I sketched out some elements and interactions. 

![Size of Network](https://i.imgur.com/PpgPd3H.jpg)

The first one I sketched out was a [staked bar graph](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/stacked_bar_graph.html) to show size and proportion of social networks. 

![Frequency of Interaction](https://i.imgur.com/arR3HVe.png)

The second one I sketched out was the Frequency of Interaction graph. This is the most complex graph to parse. 
I used the [Chord Diagram](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/chord_diagram.html) style layed out in Data Visualization Catalogue.

### Takeaways

#### Network 
Individuals on the spectrum's social network is vastly smaller than that of a neurotypicals. 
Individuals on the spectrum's social formal networks are larger than neurotypicals.

#### Interaction Types
Invididuals on the spectrum prefer telephone over face to face over internet interactions.
Though individuals on the spectrum's social network is smaller, they have reportedly more interactions with that network. 
Individuals on the spectrum have more interactions on with formal networks on the phone than face to face. 
The amount of interactions with their networks is more than that of a neurotypical. 
Neurotypicals tend to have a less, but a wider variety of interactions.
Neurotypicals prefer face to face over telephone over internet interactions.

#### Level of Satisfaction
Individuals on the spectrum are in general much more dissatisfied with the state of their social networks. 
The majority of their dissatisfaction is with their informal acquaintances (23%). 

#### What do they want?
Total Network
30% of Individuals on the spectrum want improved social skills. 

Family
60% want better contact with family members. 

Acquaintances
20% want improved social skills
20% want expanded network.

Professionals
44% want better contact

### Analyzing

Analysis of the data in contrast to current stories and other data sets helps to make the story richer.

# Compiling a Narrative

With analysis, I developed a narrative of the information and how it fits into a larger context. Key takeaways, implications, and insights are gathered.
