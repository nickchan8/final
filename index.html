<p>I am linking data about the informal networks of individuals living with autism. A new theory of understanding the well-being of people living with autism suggests that the likelihood of living a happy life is largely dependent on the size and quality of one's informal network. I found data from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4544488/"> <strong>Do Social Networks Differ? Comparison of the Social Networks of People with Intellectual Disabilities, People with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Other People Living in the Community</strong></a>

Men with high functioning autism don't have the tools or the skills or the ability to create these informal networks and have been suffering, in part, because of this. This data suggests how those living with aiming to serve individuals living with intellectual disabilities and autism should shift their programming and theories of change around developing informal networks.

Beyond the development of the networks, it is noteworthy to understand the quality of the interactions. Most of the functional characteristics of interactions tend to be practical, as opposed to 'connecting' or 'affectionate'.</p>

<p>Given the feedback I received about data around autism, I decided to find more granular detail around issues that people living with autism face.</p> 

<p>In my research about autism spectrum disorder (ASD), I have discovered the social model of disability. The social model of disability identifies people living with some disability are an oppressed group of people who need barriers removed in order for them to access the pursuit of happiness. In particular, individuals living with ASD struggle to achieve independence and a flourishing life. </p>

<p>Individuals living with ASD have a unique situation, where their condition is trapping them from components of a healthy life. In particular, they are struggling to find love and meaningful relationships. Both their clinical challenges (i.e. sensitivity to light, noise, and poor understanding of social cues) and their related impairments (i.e. depression, anxiety) distance them from the opportunity to develop meaningful relationships. According to, Belongingness and Love Needs is the 3rd most important element to human needs. The prior two elements are Psychological and Safety needs.</p> 

<p>After doing some ethnographic research and secondary research, I have discovered some theories and correlation between the amount of informal social networks and well-being. One paper in particular, Do Social Networks Differ? Comparison of the Social Networks of People with Intellectual Disabilities, People with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Other People Living in the Community, highlights this correlation. The data gathered from the study suggests that there is a much higher dissatisfaction with social networks among people with Autism Spectrum Disorder, than other intellectual disabilities and people living in the community. The research also suggests that most of the interactions for people with ASD are about practical interactions, rather than socio-emotional material.</p> 

<p>In another paper, The Structure of Informal Social Networks of Persons with Profound Intellectual and Multiple Disabilities, Kamstra suggests that increased informal networks would be a good measure of well-being, and those with intellectual disabilities are increasingly barred from these relationships as they continue to age.</p>

<p>Because most of their informal contacts, those outside social service providers and staff, tend to be only their parents, the question then becomes: How do we organize these social networks?</p> 

<p>Kamstra writes:</p>

<p>The question that arises is in what ways social contacts with people other than parents and professionals can be meaningful for persons with PIMD? In what way, can they benefit from having an extensive social network outside of their direct living environment? Until now, it remains unclear who is responsible for organizing the network, professionals or informal contact persons, and how it can be organized that existing contacts are maintained or even expand throughout the years? Considering the fact that persons with PIMD mainly depend on professionals and have contact with them on a daily basis, professionals are probably in a good position to be coordinators of a social network.</p> 

<p>In order to make this work, a protocol is needed to optimize the social networks of persons with PIMD.</p> 

<p>The data I've collected points to this call to action.</p>

<p>In order to make this work, a protocol is needed to optimize the social networks of persons with PIMD.</p>

<p>I'm curious how this data will unveil a story about leveraging staff, professional, and individuals with autism to engage together or as self-advocates to build larger informal social networks.</p> 

<p>Some interesting questions remain: what is the role of technology in this process? How does technology address social connection in an otherwise 'invisible population', to connect them to a 'visible population'?</p>
